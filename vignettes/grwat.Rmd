# Process 

Processing joins reanalysis data to raw hydrlogical data on time stamps and geographic location. It can be made using grwat in three regimes: manual, gauge folder processing and basins folder processing. 

## Manual processing

You can join reanalysis and water level data for a single gauge as follows:
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(grwat)

wd = "/Volumes/Data/Work/_grwat/Mezen_Malonisog/"

setwd(wd)

hdata = read.csv('in_Mezen_Malonisog.txt',
                 header = FALSE, 
                 sep = ' ') # read gauge data
head(hdata)

basin = st_read('Mezen_Malonisog.gpkg', quiet = TRUE) # read basin region
basin_pr = grwat::st_buffer_geo(basin, 50000)  # buffer region by 50 km

rean = grwat::read_interim('prec.nc', 'temp.nc') # read reanalysis data
hdata_rean = grwat::join_interim(hdata, rean, basin_pr) # join reanalysis data to hydrological series
head(hdata_rean$df)
```

After reanalysis data are joined you can easily plot a map of the derived spatial configuration with
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
grwat::map(rean$pts, hdata_rean$pts, basin, basin_pr) # plot spatial configuration
```


## Gauge folder

Grwat can process hydrological data that is inside one gauge folder. That folder should contain __two__ files:

- Text file with hydrological data in CSV format, space-separated (`.txt` extension)
- Spatial data file with polygon of a gauge watershed area in Geopackage (`.gpkg` extension) or Shapefile (`.shp` extension) format

The name of the file is not restricted, only the extension and the format. Here is an example:

![](in_gauge.png)

Reanalysis data should be read before using `read_interim()` function from grwat package. Having these prerequisities satisfied, the command is:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
grwat::process_gauge(wd, rean, bufsize = 50000) # process single folder
```
The value returned by this function is a number of reanalysis points extracted by buffered basin region. As a result of the execution of this function the folder receives two enriched data files and a map of the spatial configuration:

![](out_gauge.png)

> We recommend using GeoPackage because it is fast and powerful [OGC-standardized](https://www.geopackage.org) modern spatial data format that does not include any sidecar files like Esri Shapefile. You can easily convert many spatial data formats to GeoPackage by [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) _Export > Save as..._ command in a layer context menu, using `st_read` and then `st_write` functions from [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) R package, or via [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) utils if you prefer command line or need batch processing (which can also be automated in R).

> Note that if you use Shapefile format for basin border representation, you should also preserve `.dbf` and `.shx` sidecar files that store attribute information and relation between attributes and geometry. Otherwise the shapefile cannot be read correctly.

## Basins folder

Basins mode provides automation of reanalysis data joining across multiple basins and gauges. It is based on a fixed folder structure that should be organized by user. This structure is:

1. The top-level folder specified by user must contain only one folder, which is called __in__.
2. This __in__ folder contains an arbitrary number of folders (at least one), each of those corresponding to a single river __basin__.
3. Each river basin folder contains an arbitrary number of folders (at least one), each of those corresponding to a single river __gauge__.
4. Each gauge folder contains strictly two files: a `.txt` file with hydrological data, and `.gpkg` or `.shp` file with polygon of a gauge watershed area.

The names of basin and gauge folders are not restricted, but we highly recommend begin with a letter and proceed with alphanumerical symbols, underscore and a hyphen from ASCII encoding (`a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, -`)

An example of specified directory structure is provided in the picture below:

![](in_folder.png)

The processing of this folder structure is performed by `process_basins()` function:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
wd = "/Volumes/Data/Work/_grwat/2018/"
grwat::process_basins(wd, rean, bufsize = 50000) # process single folder
```

It works in a following way:

1. `process_basins()` takes __in__ folder inside folder specified by `wd` parameter and copies its content to a new __out__ folder in the same directory. All the following procedures are executed inside __out__ folder, which allows easy removal of results and rexecution of the processing if some parameters should be changed.

2. Every gauge folder is processed using `process_gauge()` function which produces enriched data files and a map inside each gauge folder. 

3. `process_basins()` also produces _summary.txt_ files inside each basin folder and one _summary.txt_ file directly in __out__ folder. These files contain a number of reanalysis points for each gauge's watershed. These are two special cases:

    - 0 means that no reanalysis data are found inside a watershed
    - -1 means that there were problems either reading `.txt` or `.gpkg`/`.shp` file

    
    In both cases the corresponding gauge folder will not contain any new files inside, and the further exploration of the problem should be taken by user. 0 means that the watershed is located outside the extent of reanalysis data or it is too small in comparison with spatial sampling of reanalysis data. Try increasing buffer size. -1 means that there are problems with your input files, and solution depends on the exact case (you must diagnose the reasons by yourself).

An example of resulting directory structure is provided in the picture below:

![](out_folder.png)

# Separate

Currently separation procedure is unavalable inside grwat package and is performed using external command-line Fortran^[In the next release of grwat package separation stage will be rewritten in C++ using Rcpp package to provide the complete workflow inside R ecosystem] program that produces two files:

- _AllGrWat.txt_ contains hydrograph separation data
- _Total.txt_ contains multiple characteristics of water discharge (they are called variables)

These output data can be visualised and statistically assessed by grwat functions that are uncovered in the next section. 

We recommend placing these files in the same folder as processed data like in a picture below:

![](sep_files.png)

# Plot and test

These functions from grwat package allow you to:

- Plot separation of hydrograph
- Plot interannual changes of key water discharge variables
- Plot long-term changes of key water discharge variables
- Perform statistical tests on all calculated variables

> Currently only English locale is provided in plots. In future releases Russian locale will also be added

## Plot separation of hydrograph

To plot separation of hydrograph you need results of a separation procedure which are saved as _AllGrWat.txt_ text file (see previous section). This file is read by `read_separation()` function:

```{r, message=FALSE}
setwd("/Volumes/Data/Work/_grwat/Mezen_Malonisog/")

sep = grwat::read_separation('AllGrWat.txt')#
head(sep)
```

You can then plot separations for selected years using `plot_separation()` function:
```{r}
grwat::plot_separation(sep, 1978) # plot single year
grwat::plot_separation(sep, c(1994, 2001)) # plot two years sequentially
grwat::plot_separation(sep, 1994:1997, # plot four years on the same page
                       layout = matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE))
```

## Read and test hydrograph variables

Interannual changes of parameters are read from _Total.txt_ file using `read_variables()` function:
```{r}
setwd("/Volumes/Data/Work/_grwat/Mezen_Malonisog/")

df = grwat::read_variables('Total.txt') # read parameters file
head(df)
```

To get the detailed description of available variables you can invoke `get_parameters()`:
```{r}
grwat::get_variables()
```

Parameters can be statistically tested using `test_variables(df, ..., year = NULL, locale='EN')` function. Names of the parameters are passed comma-separated in place of `...`. They are quoted, so you do not need to pass them as character strings, just write their names:
```{r}
grwat::test_variables(df, Qmax)
```

This is an example with three variables selected:
```{r}
tests = grwat::test_variables(df, Qygr, date10w1, Wpol3)
tests$stable
```

If you want to test all parameters, just skip variable names:
```{r}
tests = grwat::test_variables(df)
tests$change_year
```

Long-term changes are tested against breaking year, which is calculated for each variable using Pettitt test. However, if you want to use a fixed year, you should pass the desired breaking year into `change_year` parameter:
```{r}
tests = grwat::test_variables(df, Qmax, Qygr, change_year = 1987)
tests$ft # Fisher F tests to compare two variances
```

## Plot interannual changes

Interannual changes are visualized using `plot_variables()` function. Its syntax is similar to `test_variables()` and `plot_separation()`:

```{r, collapse=TRUE, message=FALSE}
grwat::plot_variables(df, Qmax) # plot one selected variable
grwat::plot_variables(df, date10w1, Wpol3) # plot two variables sequentially
grwat::plot_variables(df, Qmax, Qygr, date10w1, Wpol3, # plot four variables in matrix layout
                      layout = matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)) 
```

You can add the results of statistical tests to the plot by specifying the result of `test_variables()` function to the `tests` parameter. In that case the subtitle with test results will be added, Theil-Sen slope and Pettitt test breaking year are drawn as solid ($p \leq 0.05$) or dashed ($p > 0.05$) lines:

```{r, collapse=TRUE, message=FALSE}
grwat::plot_variables(df, date10w1, Wpol3, DaysThawWin, Qmaxpavs,
                      tests = test_variables(df, date10w1, Wpol3, DaysThawWin, Qmaxpavs)) # add test information
```

> Note that `tests` parameter of `plot_variables()` expects the tests for the same variables as those selected for plotting. If you plot variables A, B, C and supply tests for variables X, Y, Z, they will be added without any warnings, and it is your responsibility to keep them in correspondence with each other

Finally, you can plot all variables by not supplying column names to `plot_variables()` function. In that case tests (if you want to plot them too) should also be calculated for all variables:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
grwat::plot_variables(df, tests = test_variables(df))
```

## Plot long-term period changes 

Long-term changes are the differences between summarized statistics of one variable calculated for two selected periods. Because these statistics reflect the differences in distributions of parameters, grwat visualizes them as box plots using `plot_periods()` function. The syntax is similar to `plot_variables()` except that you must provide either `tests` or `year` parameter. If both are supplied then `tests` is prioritized (you can also supply a fixed year when testing variables:
```{r}
grwat::plot_periods(df, Qy, change_year = 1978)
grwat::plot_periods(df, Qy, tests = test_variables(df, Qmax))
```

Multiple plots can be combined on one page using `layout` parameter:
```{r}
grwat::plot_periods(df, Qy, Qmax, 
                    tests = test_variables(df, Qy, Qmax),
                    layout = matrix(c(1,2)))
```

To plot long-term changes for all variables just skip variable names in function call:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
grwat::plot_periods(df, tests = test_variables(df))
```

There is also a small helper function that plots a histogram of minimal discharge month for summer and winter periods:
```{r}
grwat::plot_minmonth(df, change_year = 1978)
```
