 __grwat__ package contains tools for performing scale space analysis of hydrograph. Initially developed by [@witkin:1984], this method allows decomposition of a signal into hierarchically arranged multiscale components. 

Currently __grwat__ depends on [Scale4C](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Scale4C.html) [@R-Scale4C] package from Biconductor.

```{r setup}
library(grwat)
```
