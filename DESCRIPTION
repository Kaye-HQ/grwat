Description: R package for hydrograph separation and analysis based on water level, 
    temperature and percipitation data. It makes use of geographic data processing 
    to spatially select temperature and precipitation data within the basin of each 
    gauge, average these data and join them to each element in water level series. 
    High preformance C++ code is used for hydrograph separation and analysis. 
    Discharge is separated in ground, seasonal, thaw, and flood. Interannual and 
    long-period characteristics of each discharge type are derived. Results are 
    visualized in form of high-quality graphical reports making use of 
    ggplot2 graphics and knitr report generation.
