Description: Welcome to grwat, an R package package for the automatic hydrograph separation and hydrological time series analysis. High-performance `C++17` computation is used for hydrograph processing that separates runoff into ground, seasonal, thaw, and flood runoff. Interannual and long-term characteristics of each runoff type are derived. Results are visualized in a form of high-quality reports making use of ggplot2 graphics and knitr report generation.
