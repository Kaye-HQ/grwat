Description: R package for hydrograph separation and analysis based on water level, 
    temperature and percipitation data. It makes use of geographic data processing 
    to spatially select temperature and precipitation data within the basin of each 
    gauge, average these data and join them to each element in water level series. 
    High-preformance Fortran/C++ computation is used for hydrograph processing that separates 
    water level series into ground, seasonal, thaw, and flood discharge. Interannual 
    and long-term characteristics of each discharge type are derived. Results are 
    visualized in a form of high-quality reports using ggplot2 graphics and 
    knitr report generation.
