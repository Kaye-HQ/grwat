Description: River hydrograph separation and daily runoff time series analysis. Provides
  various filters to separate baseflow and quickflow. Implements advanced separation 
  technique which involves meteorological data to revealgenetic components of the runoff: 
  ground, rain, thaw and spring (seasonal thaw). High-performance `C++17` computation, 
  annually aggregated variables, statistical testing and numerous ggplot-based functions 
  for high-quality visualization.
